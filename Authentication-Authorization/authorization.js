/* What is Authorization?:
Authorization is the procces of determining whether a user or system is allowed to access a 
particular resource or perform a particular action.
In other words, authorization is the process of granting or denying access
to protected resources based on the permissions and privileges of the user or system.

Which Comes First, Authentication or Authorization?
Autentication and authorization both rely on identity.
As you cannot authorize a user or service before identifying them, authentication always comes before authorization.
