/*What is Authentication:-
Authentication is a process that verifies that someone or something 
is who they say they are.
Technology systems typically use some form  of authentication to secure 
accesss to an application or its data. For example, when you need to access
an online site or service, you usually have to enter your username and password
.Then, behind the scenes, it compares the username and password you entered 
with a record it has on its database.If the information you submitted matches, the system assums
you are a valid user and grants you access.



// Common Types of Authentication:

Something-you-know:Passwords and Security questions are two authentication factors that
fall under this category.As Only you would know your password or the answere to a particular set
of scurity questions, sytems use this assumptions to grant you access.

Something you have: Physical devices such as smart Card, USB security tokens and mobile
phones fall under this category.for example, when you access a system ,and it sends you a One 
Time Pin(OTP) via SMS or an App, it can verify your identity beacuse it is your device.

Something you are: Biometric authentication mechanisms fall under this category.
Since individual physical characterstics such as figerprints are unique.
verifying individuals by using these factors is a secure authentication mechanism.
