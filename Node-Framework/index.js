/*What are Framworks?
1.A Framework is a software tool or platform that provides developers with 
a set of pre-written code, components, and libraries that they can use to build applications.
2.Frameworks often include a set of guidelines and best practices that help
developers to write code more efficiently and to build applications 
that are more stable,secure and scalable.
3.Some popular web developement frameworks include Ruby on Rails Django,
Laravel, React, Angular, and Vue.js
4.Framework can vary in complexity and size, from lightweighted micro-framworks that 
provides only the bare essentials, to the frameworks that include everything from front-end libraries and databse integration.
